# Matching Brackets

Welcome to Matching Brackets on Exercism's Unison Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`,
or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched
and nested correctly.

There are many ways to accomplish this exercise, but we've provided some additional stubs for folks who'd like to practice writing their own [ability handlers][ability-handler-docs].

The signature for the `checkBalance` helper function given for this exercise makes use of an ability requirement, `{Stack}`. The ability `Stack` is defined for you, but the handler, `Stack.run` is not! If you chose, you can implement the `Stack.run`, `checkBalance`, and `isPaired` function. The tests will run even if you choose not to implement this exercise with abilities.
