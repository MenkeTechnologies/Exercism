# Hints

## General

* The single quote `'` that you see in function signatures like `MyStream.fromList : [a] -> '{MyStream a} ()` is Unison's syntax for a [delayed computation](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/fundamentals/values-and-functions/delayed-computations/). Abilities and delayed computations are often seen together. Read more about this relationship and why in the [ability handler docs](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/fundamentals/abilities/using-abilities-pt2/#abilities-and-top-level-definitions).
