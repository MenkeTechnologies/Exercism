# Scrabble Score

Given a word, compute the Scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```text
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Making the test suite pass

We are using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build and test our exercises if you have a local version of Gradle installed you can use it.
If not, we have the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) installed into the exercises. If you wish to use the Gradle Wrapper please make sure `gradlew` is executable on your platform beforehand.

On MacOS/Linux, please run:

```sh
$ chmod +x gradlew
```

Execute the tests with:

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
