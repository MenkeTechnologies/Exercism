# Hamming

Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.

Your body is made up of cells that contain DNA. Those cells regularly wear out and need replacing, which they achieve by dividing into daughter cells. In fact, the average human body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime!

When cells divide, their DNA replicates too. Sometimes during this process mistakes happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded with the incorrect information. If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred. This is known as the "Hamming Distance".

We read DNA using the letters C,A,G and T. Two strands might look like this:

    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^

They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.

The Hamming Distance is useful for lots of things in science, not just biology, so it's a nice phrase to be familiar with :)

# Implementation notes

The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so
an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should
not work. The general handling of this situation (e.g., raising an
exception vs returning a special value) may differ between languages.

## Making the test suite pass

We are using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build and test our exercises if you have a local version of Gradle installed you can use it.
If not, we have the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) installed into the exercises. If you wish to use the Gradle Wrapper please make sure `gradlew` is executable on your platform beforehand.

On MacOS/Linux, please run:

```sh
$ chmod +x gradlew
```

Execute the tests with:

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
