# Error Handling

Welcome to Error Handling on Exercism's PowerShell Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors.
Because error handling is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests for your track to see what's exactly required.

The functions in the exercise are short and not supposed to be complicated.

However reading about [Exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-exceptions), and understanding the test suite is strongly recommended before starting.
