# Gigasecond

Welcome to Gigasecond on Exercism's Raku Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

Raku is aware of leap seconds.
If the tests are seconds off then this may be a cause to work around.
