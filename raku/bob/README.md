# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?".

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you YELL AT HIM (in all capitals).

He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

Bob's conversational partner is a purist when it comes to written communication and always follows normal rules regarding sentence punctuation in English.

## Resources

Remember to check out the Raku [documentation](https://docs.raku.org/) and
[resources](https://raku.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension `.rakutest`) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension `.rakumod`).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command `raku --doc *.rakutest` (\* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
`prove6 .` in the exercise directory.
