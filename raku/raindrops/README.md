# Raindrops

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation).

The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:

- has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
- has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
- has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
- _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".

## Resources

Remember to check out the Raku [documentation](https://docs.raku.org/) and
[resources](https://raku.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension `.rakutest`) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension `.rakumod`).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command `raku --doc *.rakutest` (\* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
`prove6 .` in the exercise directory.

A variation on FizzBuzz, a famous technical interview question that is intended to weed out potential candidates. That question is itself derived from Fizz Buzz, a popular children's game for teaching division. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
