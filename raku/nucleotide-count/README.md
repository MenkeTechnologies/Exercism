# Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA.
DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides.
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.

Here is an analogy:
- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA as
- legos are to lego houses as
- words are to sentences as...

## Resources

Remember to check out the Raku [documentation](https://docs.raku.org/) and
[resources](https://raku.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test suite and module included with the exercise.
The test suite (a file with the extension `.rakutest`) will attempt to run routines
from the module (a file with the extension `.rakumod`).
Add/modify routines in the module so that the tests will pass! You can view the
test data by executing the command `raku --doc *.rakutest` (\* being the name of the
test suite), and run the test suite for the exercise by executing the command
`prove6 .` in the exercise directory.
