# Grains

Welcome to Grains on Exercism's Batch Script Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince.
The king promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up.
Knowing that the king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains of wheat.
One grain on the first square of a chess board, with the number of grains doubling on each successive square.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard (where square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, and so on).

Write code that shows:

- how many grains were on a given square, and
- the total number of grains on the chessboard

However, the king ran out of grains to give the servant after day 31 since 1,073,741,824 grains is approximately 54 metric tons. 
As a 32-bit language, Batch can't represent the number of grains past this point.
