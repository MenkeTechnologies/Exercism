# High Scores

Welcome to High Scores on Exercism's Swift Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

## Some Additional Notes for Swift Implementation

The tests for this exercise expect you to implement a couple of properties that return either a value of type `Int` or an [array][array] of type `[Int]`. Feel free to skim through the Array class documentation for useful methods that may help in your solution.

The final tests check for [immutability][immutability]. None of the properties you are tasked with writing should modify the scores of the game.

If you want some extra practice, you can implement a function that adds new scores to the game or handle empty array
