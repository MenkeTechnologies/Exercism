# Hints

## 1. Calculate the interest rate

- Use a conditional expression as an [`if`][if] statement and compare the `balance` to the different ranges.
- The `return` keyword can be used to do an early return from a method.

## 2. Calculate the interest

- When calculating interest, it might be helpful to notice that `interest_rate` returns a percentage.

## 3. Calculate the annual balance update

- When calculating the annual balance update, we can use methods we have defined in previous steps.

## 4. Calculate the years before reaching the desired balance

- To calculate the years, one can keep looping until the desired balance is reached. This can be done with a [`while`][while] loop.
