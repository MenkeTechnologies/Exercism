# Hints

## 1. Find card in the deck

- There is a [built-in method][index] that can find the first element in the collection that meets the condition specified in the block, and return its index or `nil` if no element is found.

## 2. Make all characters capitalized

- There is  a [built-in method][map] to transform all elements in the collection.
- There is a [built-in method][capitalize] to capitalize a words for `String`.

## 3. Calculate the power level of all cards

- You can use the [`sum` method] to calculate the total power level of all cards.
- The `sum` method can also accept a block to transform the elements before summing them.

## 4. Decode a card

- There is a [built in method][each_with_char] to iterate over the characters of a `String` with an index.
