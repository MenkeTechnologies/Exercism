# Hints

## General

- You need to use different forms of [control-flow][control-flow] to solve this exercise.

## 1. Check for criticality

- You need to use [if][if] or [unless][unless] statements to solve this exercise.
- You need to use [comparison operators][equality-and-comparison] to solve this exercise.
- To combine multiple conditions you can use [`&&`][and] and [`||`][or].

## 2. Determine the Power output range

- You can create multiple branches using `if` and `elsif`.

## 3. Fail Safe Mechanism

- You can use `if` and `elsif` to create multiple branches.
